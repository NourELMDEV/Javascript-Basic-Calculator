How It works:
- You can setup your welcome page however you want, all you need is a couple of inputs with the type "text" , then assign an id to it. In your javascript file you can assign a function for each input group (what I mean by "group" is the input 1 for the "num1" and input 2 for the "num2" text input.) 
- For my case I assigned case 1 "a" and case 2 "b" and for the result I assigned the variable "c" then made an alert with the var c which shows you the results.
